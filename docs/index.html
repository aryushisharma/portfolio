                <div class="h-50"></div>
                <p>Drawing inspiration from traditional art, folk tales, personal experiences, and emotional inspirations, my passion as a textile designer is to effect positive socio-cultural change through my designs. I actively participate in initiatives that address period poverty in India to make a difference. My expertise in digital art, weaving, textile print design, and natural dyeing constantly challenges me to explore new possibilities in my craft.</p>
                <p>One of my current interests lies in the interplay between textiles and scent, and I am collaborating with experts in aromatherapy and perfumery to integrate fragrances into my designs. Furthermore, I am involved in publishing and children's literature, working on a proposal for a book of textures and scents designed for children. I am dedicated to harnessing the power of design as a tool for creating a meaningful impact on society through innovative and socially conscious designs.</p>

                        <h3>"garden of memories"</h3>
                        <div class="h-50"></div>
                        <p>The  pandemic has brought about unprecedented challenges for individuals across the globe, leading to emotional and physical struggles that weigh down the soul. During these trying times, individuals seek comfort in memories that evoke happiness, comfort, and a sense of connection to their true selves. In this journal, the author recounts their personal experience with finding solace in childhood memories and using them as a source of inspiration to create fragrant enchantments that can serve as triggers for healing and staying connected to one's spirit. </p>
                        <p>The author argues that memories need to be stronger than words, emotions, or appearances and should be sensory in their being to withstand the flow of time and keep their essence intact. By tapping into natural selves through sensory memories, individuals can find strength and move forward through life's crossroads.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p>I embarked on a project that explored the exciting potential of infusing scents onto textiles to create a unique sensorial experience. My initial interest stemmed from my curiosity about the world of scents and fragrances, and their powerful ability to evoke memories and feelings of comfort and relaxation. I recognized that textiles also have a similar ability to provide comfort through touch, which sparked the idea of combining the two senses to create a new way of experiencing scents.</p>
                        <p>To achieve this, I utilized the technique of colour, material, and finish (CMF) to derive natural smells and colours. My goal was to create a more immersive experience by connecting multiple sensory experiences to one feeling, allowing the user to revisit a comfortable experience. Through this project, I aimed to enhance the experience of wearing, feeling, and visualizing scents through textiles, while also using textiles as a form of therapy to transcend time and space.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p>Overall, my project demonstrated the immense potential of infusing scents onto textiles to create a new and exciting sensorial experience. I believe that there is much more to explore in this field, and I am excited to continue to push the boundaries of what is possible.</p>

                        <h3>Paracosm</h3>
                        <img src="docs/img/1 gulzaar/DSC_0191.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <br />
                        <p>Incorporating the concept of paracosm and the therapeutic nature of scents, my project aimed to create a series of textile pieces that transport individuals into a world of comfort and familiarity. Drawing inspiration from the Victorian era's enchantments and magical creatures, I introduced the narrative of fragrant fairies into my collection. These fragrant fairies serve as an attachment to individuals, providing them with a source of comfort and calm during difficult times.</p>
                        <p>Through my project, I wanted to emphasize the importance of having a world of one's own to retreat to when things are tough. The fragrant fairies serve as a reminder that even in times of uncertainty, individuals can hold on to something familiar and comforting. By combining the therapeutic nature of scents with the concept of paracosm, I aimed to create a collection of pieces that provide a sensory experience and a tool for emotional healing and comfort.</p>

                        <strong>“Design for a world that is reprioritizing connection.”</strong>
                        <p>The Care Culture story resonates deeply with my project as it highlights the importance of prioritizing wellbeing, community, and planet in the post-pandemic world. I believe that my project aligns with this narrative by emphasizing the significance of care in the creation of textiles and fragrances that are designed to enhance and heal the mind and body.</p>

                        <p>My focus on sustainable creation from fibre to fabric aligns with the story's emphasis on finding ways to better the health of people and the planet. I believe that by utilizing haptic materials, mood-boosting colors, and earthy textures, my project can connect people back to nature and themselves, providing a sense of comfort and familiarity in any setting.</p>
                        
                        <p>Furthermore, my project's incorporation of old traditions and the use of scents to aid in mental and physical well-being aligns with the Care Culture story's emphasis on recognizing and valuing cultures and customs. By crafting pieces that recreate familiar comforts, I hope to provide a sentiment of care for those who interact with my creations.</p>

                        <p>Overall, I see great potential to develop my project into a bigger picture that aligns with the values of the Care Culture story. By remaining flexible, crafting simple yet impactful pieces, and focusing on local materials and techniques, I believe that my project can contribute to the greater narrative of prioritizing care in the post-pandemic world.</p>

                        <h3>Colour, Material and Finish</h3>
                        <img src="docs/img/1 gulzaar/01-01.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <p>The approach for creating the Gulzaar palette was centred around promoting a sense of well-being, calming mood, and complementing soothing neutrals. The inspiration came from the sustainable practice of using materials that come from nature and have the potential to go back to it. To achieve this, the focus was on selecting colour pigments derived from nature and experimenting with tones to achieve the desired effect.</p>
                        <p>In particular, fruit dyes were chosen for the collection, as they were intended for children and connected to the creator's childhood imagination. The pink and purple neutrals derived from berries were found to perfectly complement the creator's vision of a childhood wonderland, and the experimentations with colour, material, and form. In addition to deriving the colours from the fruit, the scents they gave off were also encapsulated into the collection to further enhance the sensory experience.</p>
                        <p>All dyes used to create the colour palette were natural, and the creator began by experimenting with food dyes to find the perfect combination. Ultimately, the colours of strawberries, blueberries, and cochineal were chosen to create a calming and subtle palette that resembled nudes and skins, but with a pop of natural colour. The aim of the Gulzaar palette was to provide a high-energy burst of feelings and to evoke nostalgia while also promoting a sense of calm and well-being.</p>
                        <br />

                        <h3>The Collection – Final Pieces</h3>
                        <img src="docs/img/1 gulzaar/1F24B8D9-DC4A-42B1-B645-43B9AED15742.jpeg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <br />
                        <p>The final pieces in this collection are a result of a thoughtful and deliberate process of exploration and experimentation. The approach was centered around conveying the journey of how a feeling or experience embeds itself in our minds and slowly unfurls with the introduction of a familiarity catalyst. Each piece was designed with the intention of being an attachment that could revive the senses and memories associated with it.</p>
                        <p>The final pieces in the collection include sensory wall hangings, woven textiles, and fragrant fairies. Each piece was designed with care and attention to detail, and crafted using sustainable materials and techniques. The Gulzaar palette of soothing neutrals and mood-boosting colors promotes a sense of wellbeing and calm. The collection as a whole is a testament to the power of nature, memory, and healing.</p>

                        <h3>Instigation</h3>
                        <img src="docs/img/1 gulzaar/3.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <br />
                        <p>The piece aims to initiate memory instigation by using a scratch and smell binder in the printing process to enhance the viewer's sensory experience and memory recall. The printed pattern conveys the detailed and mouldable aspect of textiles and serves as a stimulus for memory recall. Printed textiles are used as a metaphor as they are flexible and allow for intricate and detailed imagery, making them a perfect medium to create visual representations of memories. Overall, Blanket One serves as the initial trigger for the memory recall process associated with the collection.</p>

                        <br />

                        <h3>Merging</h3>
                        <img src="docs/img/1 gulzaar/6.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <br />
                        <p>The piece in the collection represents the second stage of memories, where the defined vivid imageries begin to merge and fade into one another. The interlacing of yarns - weaving - is used as a symbol of this merging process, with three different colours of yarns used to create an ombre effect. The dyeing process followed a merging method, where two hanks of yarn were dyed in two different baths, and the third bath was a mixture of both batches with hints of a different pigment. Chamomile scents were infused into the yarns, which were then woven as the weft, while the warm colour was left undyed. The overall effect of the blanket is to evoke a sense of memories merging and fading into one another, with a soft and soothing scent that complements the visual experience.</p>

                        <h3>Embedding</h3>
                        <img src="docs/img/1 gulzaar/8.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <br />
                        <p>The blanket represents the third stage of memories, where only a hazy piece of the experience remains embedded in our minds. The technique used to convey this stage is embellishing two pieces of fabric together, creating a hazy effect on the design. The fusion of the two fabrics represents the memory embedding itself as one, and the hazy effect on one side of the fabric fits perfectly with the idea of the last stage of memory recall. Blanket Three is a children's standard blanket.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p>The Felt Cardigan with attachments serves as the final piece of the collection, emphasizing the significance of memories in our healing and well-being. It highlights the impact of scents on our senses and how they can aid in our healing process. The cardigan features small enchantments that represent worry fairies in a garden, creating a whimsical atmosphere that helps to alleviate anxiety and worries. Overall, the cardigan emphasizes the importance of memories and the role they play in our emotional and physical health.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <img src="docs/img/1 gulzaar/IMG_0348.jpeg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <br />
                        <p>In conclusion, the textile collection presented above is an embodiment of memories and the emotions attached to them. The collection takes the viewer through three stages of memory instigation, starting with the initial trigger, followed by the merging of memories, and concluding with embedded memories. Each piece in the collection is a symbol of these stages and uses various textile techniques to convey the intended message. The scratch and smell binder, interlacing of yarns, and embellishing techniques all play a significant role in the collection's narrative. Additionally, the use of scents in the Felt Cardigan with attachments emphasizes the importance of sensory experiences in memory recall and healing. The collection serves as a reminder of the power of memories and the role they play in our lives, and how textiles can be used to create visual representations of these memories.</p>

                        <div class="h-50"></div>
                        <p>The relationship between man and nature is a delicate balance that has been at the forefront of human consciousness since the beginning of time. It is this complex and intricate relationship that serves as the inspiration for a new print collection that weaves together the biblical concept of 7 days of creation with the reality of human impact on the environment.</p>
                        <p>This collection takes a quirky and thought-provoking approach to exploring the relationship between God and man's creation, and how it has changed over time. The prints depict the gradual changes in human lifestyles, and the drastic effects that these changes have had on the natural world.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p>The concept behind the collection is to convey a message about the invasion of human lifestyles into the wild, and how it has resulted in a shift in the environment. However, the prints also illustrate how humans inevitably reach back to nature whenever they need a break from the monotony of daily life.
                        The message of the collection is clear: it is time to save what we have instead of creating an artificial illusion of the same. The prints serve as a reminder that we must work to protect the environment, and strive to maintain a balance between man and nature.</p>
                        <p>As we look at the prints in this collection, we are forced to confront the reality of the impact that our lifestyles have had on the environment. However, we are also inspired to take action and make changes that will help to preserve and protect the natural world.</p>

                        <p>A giraffe doesn’t think about his purpose in the grand scheme of things. He has nothing to say, for he has no vocal cords. He just goes about giraffing in both light and in darkness.</p>

                        <p>“On the third day of creation, the earth put forth the green. All grasses, seeds, trees and all that was green came to being.”</p>

                        <p>“Then came evening. And then morning. A fifth day.” Upon came all remaining creatures. Everything that creeps and everything that crawls.</p>

                        <p>So God rested on the very seventh day. He blessed the day and made it holy, And that was the close of the creation story.</p>

                        <p>It is also important to learn from animals, for they are there to teach us the way of life. These ‘beings of the green’ are constantly teaching us about ourselves and the universe.</p>

                        <p>Sea Through is a unique and innovative project that aims to celebrate the beauty of sea life through the art of oriental crafts. Inspired by the reconstructed legacy trend, the project seeks to elevate the traditional craft of oriental latticework by incorporating it into designs featuring sea creatures such as fish and crustaceans.</p>
                        <p>The idea behind Sea Through is to create a series of stunning works of art that not only showcases the intricate beauty of the sea life but also highlight the delicate and intricate details of the oriental latticework. By bringing these two elements together, the project aims to create a unique and visually stunning aesthetic that celebrates the natural world's beauty while honouring the traditional art of oriental crafts.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p>The project employs a range of techniques and materials, including laser cutting, etching, and intricate handcrafted details, to bring the designs to life. The use of these techniques and materials not only enhances the visual appeal of the artworks but also ensures that each piece is unique and one-of-a-kind.</p>
                        <p>One of the key features of Sea Through is the play of negative and positive space that creates a sense of depth and dimensionality in the designs. This play of negative and positive space is achieved through the use of the latticework, which creates a delicate and intricate framework that enhances the natural beauty of the sea creatures.</p>

                        <p>Think of Judy is a reflection of the poem, imagine a women in terms of how we are trying our best to push ourselves to be the best version of ourselves and how every women is a goddess in herself. Think of Judy is the story which will reflects upon the phrases of the poem Imagine a woman by Patricia Lynn Reilly.</p>

                        <img src="img/5 thinkofjudy/Theme board_.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <br />
                        <p>The whole story came up to the highlight when the trend spotting lead to the idea of body positivity in the market.
                        From merchandising idea to product range every company is trying to expand their product range for all the body types and skin colours.</p>
                        <p>Using the idea, the market study was done for plus size market specifically for the trend spotting of silhouettes and designs where the trend spoke majorly about graphic abstract prints and silhouettes of boxy fits, blazer trend and shirts. After following the trend of body positivity and catering the plus size market, the idea of making prints for women and about women came up. The plus size women usually prefer wear prints as it helps the body imagery in general by creating an illusion of curves and flattering their bodies in the best way possible.</p>
                        <br />
                        <img src="docs/img/5 thinkofjudy/Untitled-8.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" />
                        <br />
                        <p>Think of Judy is a story telling about a women and the journey of acceptance on their body and loving the flaws.
                        Thinking of judy is an image of a women that we imagine as the best version of a woman, Judy. The inspiration is taken from the poem, "Imagine a women" which speaks about visiualising a perfect women who accepts and loves herself and enjoys being a women. The idea is too illustrate the poets imagery in abstrat and simplified version of women following the trend of abstract and bold prints with illustrated imageries.</p>
                        <p>The trend of poetic typography is interpreted in a beautiful twist of emotion depicting drawings. The colour palatte followed is also picked up from the major trend colours used in the plus size market recently. Using the major trend of body positivity movement in the fashion and how the drive of acceptance is a trend will be the major idea of making prints which shows diversity among women and their qualities. Beauty for all strategy is about the acceptance of women imagery and Think of Judy speaks about giving power and a sense of boldness to a women through her clothing by making something that she is comfortable in like her skin.</p>

                        <p>Calcutta, the city of joy - This is a city known by many names and coloured in as many hues. The capital of british India, Kolkata, is a beautiful collage of the english imperial culture and the traditional Bengali way of life, inspired and interspreads with all the elements of a modern metropolis.</p>
                        <p>If we dwell deeper, bereft of pre-concieved judgements the experiences is sure to be one that will leave a deep impact on you, for Kolkata is a city to be felt, heard and smelled, as much as it is to be seen.</p>

                        <h3>Final Concepts</h3>
                        <p>The main concept of the theme was the wire poles and the yellow taxi pattern which was inspired by the first two eyecatching things as soon as you step inside the city of Calcutta, The sky view above you will have the entangled wires more than the clear blue sky. The yellow ambassador taxi has always been the highlight of the city and also is the major colour pop of the city roads.</p>

                        <p>A contemporary take on the traditional embroidery of
                        India, Kasuti and Fez embroidery of Morocco. Both the embroideries follow a similar visual language.
                        Kasuti and Fez both are counted thread embroidery and follows simple straight and cross stitches.</p>
                        <p>For this particular piece, I have opted the visual context of both and tried to contemporize it with using velvet fabric which is not essentially woven.
                        The product was made to combine two very different cultures and find a common ground between them and yet make it look modern.</p>

                        <p>The theme flimsy crayola means delicate pastels and the inspiration for the design was Matilda from the movie Leon. The crayola or colours of the life of Matilda and the last scene of her planting the plant on the ground and acknowledging her love for Leon is shown through the florals around the potrait.</p>
                        <p>This sling bag was made for people who like a safe paced life with a routine. The design and colour of the bag is such that it can carry your essentials and can be a go to with every outfit. The colours were choosen keeping a everyday life product mood.</p>

                        <p>Ilkal was an ancient weaving center where the weaving seems to have started in the 8th century AD. The growth of these sarees is attributed to the patronage provided by the local chieftains in and around the town of Bellary. The most down to earth yet vibrant colors are seen in traditional saree of Ilkal. Ilkal is a small town, located in the South- East part of Bagalkot district,North Karnataka, India.</p>
                        <p>Weaving of Ilkal sarees is mostly an indoor activity. It is essentially a household enterprise involving active participation of female members.</p>

                        <p>A team of 30 students divided into 3 groups travelled to Ilkal village to live with the weavers and help them grow their business and craft by helping them with new designs and colours yet respecting the authenticity of the craft, Ilkal saree.</p>
                        <p>Two weavers, one on a natural dyed warp and one on a synthetic dyed warp handloom were assigned to the team to develop their digital designs into samples while interacting with the villagers and the team.</p>
